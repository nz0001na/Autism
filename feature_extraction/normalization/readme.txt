This project is used to normalize face pictures.

To normalize, use 'normlization.m'

There are also other useful files.

'newPoints.m' is used to transfer points from former pictures to normalized ones.

'meanVar.m' is used to compute mean and var for variation of points between different faces from choosed and labeled 100 white and women samples.
